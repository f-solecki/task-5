DESCRIPTION

Create an application tour. This tour should describe some functions of the app (like a tutorial). Tour should consist of 5 screens. On every screen, please attach an image, page title, short description, and a button with "next" text on it. When a user clicks on the "next" button, the app should display the next screen. There is no "next" button on the last screen of the tour.
